# ASP.NET Core with OData Conventions Example

This example project illustrates using ASP.NET Core with OData by applying API version metadata with conventions
instead of attributes. This approach is useful if you prefer not to decorate controllers with API versions or in a
scenario where you might not have the ability to apply attributes yourself, such as in a plug-in model. Launch the
project and try the [example requests](Examples.http) to view an API in action.
