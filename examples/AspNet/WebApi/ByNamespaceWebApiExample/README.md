# ASP.NET Web API Version By Namespace Convention Example

This example project illustrates using ASP.NET Web API controllers which have their API version applied using the
[version by .NET namespace convention][wiki] instead of attributes. This approach is useful if you prefer not to
decorate controllers with API versions and have them automatically versioned using the .NET namespace that defines
their type. Launch the project and try the [example requests](Examples.http) to view an API in action.
